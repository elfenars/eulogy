### Get it running:

1. Install Ruby-2.1.1 (Use rvm or rbenv or do it manually... whatever tickles your pickle.)
2. Install the gems with ``bundle install``
3. Install [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) on Chrome (or Firefox... again, whatever suits you.)
4. Run guard and start coding!

**NOTE:** Guard and LiveReload is just to save some time when doing the design and toying around with the Frontend.

You can of course just run Thin, Shotgun or again... whatever webserver floats your boat.
